/// IMPORTANT: This file only mocks generated code and is *not* used by the generator!
///
/// Reason is that base source files are currently still self-contained and compilable,
/// they just miss a few minor code-generated parts to build which we can provide here.
///
/// There are a few downsides to the whole approach, and while it belongs into a readme
/// they should at least be noted now that I have them in mind:
///  - Hardcoded namespaces, makes it impossible to use/release this as a generic project
///  - Dynamic stuff only possible before/after the files, or with hacky replacements
